# Management-Handbook

This is a an open book of Management. The vast majority of what I do as a
manager is intentional and thought out. Very little I do is by accident. As I
write out what I am doing, I will share it here. If there is anything I do that
you don't understand please ask.

I will presume some of the things I am doing are not ideal. The goal here is
both for you to understand what I am doing and for me to improve.
