The purpose of a one-on-one is to build a relationship and maintain good open
communciation.

The format of a one-on-one is a 30 minutes every once a week every week. The
structure is three blocks of ten minutes each:

- Ten minutes for you
- Ten minutes for me
- Ten minutes to talk about the future

At least the first ten minutes are to talk about anything you want to talk about. Work,
pets, your car, your family, your hobbies, your weekend, your vacation--anything
at all.

The second ten minutes are for talking about anything I need to share with you.
Things I might need from you, a place to share feedback from me or others. This
is a two way conversation to make sure we are aligned.

The last ten minutes are for talking about the future -- your career growth,
training, development, or opportunities.

Either of the first two sections might take fifteen minutes, and that's fine.

There are many reasons for this format that I'm happy to share with you if you
are interested. Just know that not only have I found this effective, but they
are based on thousands of one-on-ones practiced across many organizations. Each
piece is there for a reason.
